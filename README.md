# memory_map
Visualize Linux process memory pages.

This is a simple Rust tool to analyse the allocated memory space for a process under Linux.

The plan is to visualize both the virtual memory of a process and its mapping to physical memory, mostly as a pedagogical tool to understand memory allocation and mapping under Linux.
